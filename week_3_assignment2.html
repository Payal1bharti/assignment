        <h2 class="sd">1. Regular Check-ups:</h2>
            <p class="ad sd">One should get annual physical check up to make sure everything is as it should be. There is no harm getting regular check ups as it's good for your own body. Do breast or testicular self-exams and get suspicious moles checked out. Getting exams regularly benefits you because if and when something is abnormal, you will get to know about it timely and can consult with your doctor.</p>
            <h2 class="sd">2. Healthy Eating Habits</h2>
            <p class="ad sd">Eat a lot of colours (P.S. Colours do not mean candies here). Try and make your plate colourful with many fruits and veggies. Make sure you incorporate the habit of a balanced and healthy diet. It is also essential that you plan your meals well. You may make your own food calendar and set timings for a meal. The number one reason that diets fail is that cravings take over, so choose a way of eating that still incorporates some of our favourite food, but do not overeat. Change your mindset from “dieting” to adopting to healthy and active “lifestyle”.</p>
            <h2 class="sd">3. Stay Hydrated</h2>
            <p class="ad sd">Hydration is very crucial when it comes to good health.

Many health-related issues are related to dehydration in the body. Energising effervescent hydration drinks like Fast&Up Reload offer instant and effective hydration and energy with no added sugar.</p>
