        <h2>The Top Ten: The World's Highest Mountains</h2>
        <p>The top 10 highest mountains in the world, from Mount Everest and K2 to Manaslu and Annapurna. These are the world's highest summits. The highest mountain in the world is Mount Everest, sitting pretty at 8,848m in the Himalayas in Nepal. It's likely you already knew that. After all, ask 100 people in the world to name a mountain, and most will say Mount Everest. A lot of people also know that the second highest mountain in the world is K2, on the China-Pakistan border, but far fewer know that the third highest mountain in the world is called Kangchenjunga. Or how to spell that. It’s not quite as simple as ‘K2’, that’s for sure. So, how many of the highest mountains in the world do you really know?

            Everest tends to hog all the fame, but actually, the entire continent of Asia is full of huge mountains. The top 100 tallest mountains in the world are all in Asia. None of the seven summits - the highest mountains on each continent - are on this list except Everest. It's actually quite rare to find someone who knows about the sixth, seventh or eighth highest mountains in the world.</p>
